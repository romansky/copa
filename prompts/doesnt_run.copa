I'm working on an OSS project

This is the source of it:

```
{{@../src}}
```

These are the current tests:

````
{{@../tests}}
````

I have an issue with unicode characters, specifically when I use my library to copy,
it's turning `FCN: F × X → {` into `FCN: F √ó X ‚Üí {`.

Can you help me set up a test for this?
