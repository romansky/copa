I'm working on an OSS project

```
{{@./snips/about_project.md}}
```

This is the source:

```
{{@../src}}
```

The feature I'm working on is:
- Add support for generating simple ASCII tree for a given location (assuming its a directory)
For example when I do `@../src:dir`- this will be generated as directory structure instead of contents.

The issue is that it's implemented using fs and not using `filterFiles`, as a result it's not respecting git ignore for example..
