I'm working on an OSS project

```
{{@./snips/about_project.md}}
```

This is the source:

```
{{@../src}}
```

When I run tests, it this is what I get:
````
===== component.tsx (imports removed) =====
````

While expecting:
````
===== src/components/component.tsx (imports removed) =====
````

How can I fix this?
