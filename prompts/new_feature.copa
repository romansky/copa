I'm working on an OSS project

```
{{@./snips/about_project.md}}
```

This is the source:

```
{{@../src}}
```

Please help me add support for embedding web pages, the inner location would be:
`@https://www.example.com/page.html`

Just leave a placeholder function with the url as input and expect string as output, I will implement the inside of it..
