I'm working on an OSS project

```
{{@./snips/about_project.md}}
```

This is the source:

```
{{@../src}}
```

Please help me add support for removing imports from imported sources files using `:remove-imports` modifier 
(if you have a better name for it, let me know)

- applies when importing single file or a folder
- per language handling by filename (`.ts`, `.tsx`)
- for now just implement for `.ts` & `.tsx`
