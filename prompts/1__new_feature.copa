I'm working on an OSS project

```
{{@./snips/about_project.md}}
```

This is the source:

```
{{@../src}}
```

Please help me add support for generating simple ASCII tree for a given location (assuming its a directory)

For example when I do `@../src:dir`- this will be generated as directory structure instead of contents.
This is not implemented optimally, when I use `@.:-*.md,-**/subdir/**` its being detected as "dir"...
